# Future Ideas
## Forks
It may be helpful to be able to answer questions like "How many Bitcoin Cash do I have, and where?"
for forks like Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Gold, ... that share parts of their blockchain with Bitcoin.
This can be done by making use of the block height information (before/after a fork?), and making the
code fork-aware.

## Interactive CLI
Running `get-neighbour-transactions` and the other commands repeatedly is quite frustrating.
BitBook should offer an interactive mode that guides the user to completion.
